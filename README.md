# Recordly dbt hackathon 4.11.2021

This is the repo for [Recordly](https://www.recordlydata.com) data build tool hackathon! Feel free to follow along, and do check our open jobs at [Recordly/Careers](https://www.recordlydata.com/careers)

The structure of the repo is the following:
* This README.md is an introduction on how to get started
* [/general](/general) contains supporting material about data build tool. Kinda like Powerpoints, but in Markdown.
* [/hackathon](/hackathon) has instructions and tasks. Follow that.
* [/finished](/finished) has the answers. So major SPOILERS there :)

This hackathon was done on Snowflake using TPC-H dataset as an example. https://github.com/electrum/tpch-dbgen was used to generate new data made available to participants via Azure Blob storage.

The goal for this dbt hackathon is 
* to give basic idea about what dbt does, 
* what it doesn't do, 
* how to set it up and start  using it, 
* how to expand it with packages and macros, 
* and what to consider when creating a production ready environment

## Recordly hackathon?

At Recordly, we hold monthly hackathons. The goal of the hackathons is to share and deepen our knowledge on different technical topics. That is the first part of the hackathons. The other part is to evolve our company. Like products, our company evolves through various versions and hackathons play an important role in this. You can read more on our hackathons at
