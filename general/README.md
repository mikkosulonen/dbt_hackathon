# General - Recordly dbt hackathon 4.11.2021

This README.md contains supporting material about data build tool. Kinda like Powerpoints, but in Markdown.

The goal for this dbt hackathon is 
* to give basic idea about what dbt does, 
* what it doesn't do, 
* how to set it up and start using it, 
* how to expand it with packages and macros, 
* and what to consider when creating a production ready environment
